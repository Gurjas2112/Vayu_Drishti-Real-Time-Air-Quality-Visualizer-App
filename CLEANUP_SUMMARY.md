## How to Regenerate Removed Files (if needed):

### Flutter Build Files:
```bash
cd frontend_code
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk    # For Android
flutter build ios    # For iOS
```

### Backend Dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Android Gradle Cache:
```bash
cd frontend_code/android
./gradlew clean
```

## Project Structure After Cleanup:

```
frontend_code/
├── lib/
│   └── screens/profile/notifications/
│       └── notifications_screen.dart  ✅ (Active - Modern UI)
├── pubspec.yaml
└── ... (other source files)

backend/
├── src/
├── package.json  ✅ (Dependencies list preserved)
└── ... (other source files)
```

## Benefits:

1. **Reduced Storage**: Project size reduced by over 1GB
2. **Faster Sync**: Smaller project for version control
3. **Clean Structure**: Removed redundant/duplicate files
4. **Development Ready**: All source code and configurations preserved

## Notes:

- All source code files are preserved
- Configuration files (package.json, pubspec.yaml) remain intact
- Only build artifacts and caches were removed
- Project will rebuild these files automatically when needed
- No functionality lost - all enhancements to notifications system preserved

The project is now significantly lighter while maintaining all functionality and recent enhancements!
